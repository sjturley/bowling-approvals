* What about whitespace in our approved file?
* As I'm building incrementally I can't comment out parts of approved file so I can refactor, but I can ignore the last line
* Need to remember to keep limit on collection in sync otherwise you print out all the data instead of doing 1 at a time
* If you miss a micro-commit, could possibly use local history to recreate.
* This will not work for multiple strikes in a row
* Try this as an HTML line for output
* Implement isScored concept on frames. display score when it becomes available
